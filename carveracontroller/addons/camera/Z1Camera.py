"""
Live camera on the Makera Z1.

The camera is served by the Z1's ESP32 WiFi module rather than the motion
firmware: a WebSocket on port 82 that starts pushing frames once the client
sends ``start_stream``, one whole JPEG per binary message. The stream is fixed
at 640x480 by that firmware and exposes no sensor controls, which is why
``CameraView`` grades frames on the host instead.

Frames are read on a worker thread; callbacks are dispatched on the Kivy main
thread. A dropped socket does not end the session: the worker reconnects until
``stop`` closes it.
